Shiny applications for teaching a graphical version of the old-Keynesian IS-MP-AS model

Accompaying e-mini-textbook (which embeds app) is here: https://people.carleton.edu/~estruby/ASAD/

More applications are likely to come before the next time I teach introductory macro, but that won't be until academic year 2022-23!
